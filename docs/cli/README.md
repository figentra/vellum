# CLI Reference

`vellum <command> [arguments] [options]`. `vellum --help` prints the same list.

Exit status: **0** PASS or done, **1** FAIL or refused, **2** INCONCLUSIVE (nothing to examine,
an input that could not be read), a usage error, or a command that is not implemented. An
option a command does not declare is a usage error, never ignored.

Every command runs inside a git work tree and reads specs from `.agents/specs/<NNN>-<slug>/`.
A spec is _managed_ when it has a `.sdlc/` machine folder or artifacts with Lifecycle
Frontmatter; otherwise it is _legacy_: listed, not validated.

## Files Vellum reads and writes

| Path                                              | Written by  | Contents                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.sdlc/policy.json` (repository root)             | a human     | The Approval Policy: approvers, their signing keys, required counts per risk class            |
| `<spec>/requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` | authors     | Lifecycle Frontmatter (`version`, `checksum`, `state`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) and the body |
| `<spec>/.sdlc/ledger.jsonl`                       | Vellum only | Hash-chained ledger entries                                                                   |
| `<spec>/.sdlc/ledger.head.json`                   | Vellum only | The last entry's id and digest                                                                |

The Artifact Checksum is the SHA-256 of the body's canonical form: frontmatter, line endings,
trailing whitespace, table padding and Task Markers do not change it; any word does.

### Approval Policy

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "repository": "my-repo",
  "approval": {
    "schema_version": "1.0",
    "approvers": [
      {
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "authorised_for": ["standard"],
        "keys": [
          {
            "type": "ssh",
            "fingerprint": "SHA256:…",
            "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA… alice"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "requirements": { "standard": { "count": 1 } },
    "spec_risk_classes": { "016-payments": "high" }
  }
}
```

Every key needs its `public_key` (an OpenSSH public key line, or an ASCII-armored GPG key);
an SSH key's `fingerprint` must be the one `ssh-keygen -lf` prints for that key, or the policy
is refused. A spec not listed in `spec_risk_classes` is `standard`.

## Commands

### `vellum status [spec] [--json]`

Per spec: the Recorded Lifecycle State (from `requirements.md`), each artifact's version and
whether its frontmatter checksum is current, valid approvals against the policy, required tasks
with passing evidence and failed attempts, and ledger integrity. The Effective Lifecycle State
is reported as _not computed_: this version does not compute it. Exit 0; 2 when a spec cannot
be read or the fragment matches no spec or several.

### `vellum lint [spec] [--type=requirements|design|tasks] [--json]`

The Protocol Validator: the spec folder holds only the three artifacts and `.sdlc/`; each
artifact's frontmatter parses and its checksum matches its body; task markers are one of
`[ ]`, `[~]`, `[-]`, `[x]`; a task's `<!-- criteria: … -->` references exist in
`requirements.md`; and, without `--type`, every ledger entry passes its schema and the chain
and head are intact. Output ends with what was examined. Exit 1 on any finding; 2 when no
managed artifact was examined.

Not checked yet: the Markdown Protocol rules of criteria 11.2, 11.5 and 11.6.

### `vellum verify [spec] [--strict] [--json]`

The Strict Verifier. `--strict` is accepted; there is no lenient mode. Per spec:

- the ledger chain and the Ledger Head;
- each approval: the commit that added its ledger line must change only the spec's ledger
  files and carry a signature that verifies against a key the policy lists for the approving
  identity, from a human session, and the approval must bind the artifact's current checksum;
- every criterion is covered by a task and every property is cited by one;
- every required (non-optional) task has an Evidence Entry with exit status 0 at HEAD or an
  ancestor of it.

Without a spec argument it verifies each managed spec whose Recorded state is `IN_PROGRESS` or
later. Exit 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 INCONCLUSIVE (nothing to verify, or an unreadable input or
invalid policy).

### `vellum doctor [--json]`

Evaluates Node.js (>= 22), git (>= 2.34), the repository, the Approval Policy and the signing
tools its keys need, each managed spec's ledger integrity, and untracked documents under
`.agents/specs/`. Reports _Assistant plugin version_, _Repository hooks_, _Stale markers_,
_ADR supersession_ and _Disposable cache_ as `NOT_CHECKED` — not implemented, never PASS.
Exit 1 when an evaluated diagnostic fails.

### `vellum approve <spec> <requirements|design|tasks> [--reject --rationale=<text>]`

Writes an Approval Record (or a Rejection Record) for the artifact's current version and
checksum under `git config user.email`. It refuses outside an interactive terminal, in CI, in
a detected assistant session, without a policy, for an identity the policy does not authorise
or lists no key for, and on a damaged ledger.

The record is **not valid when the command finishes**. It becomes valid when the approver
commits it — a commit changing only `.sdlc/ledger.jsonl` and `.sdlc/ledger.head.json`, signed
with their policy key:

```bash
git add .agents/specs/016-x/.sdlc/ledger.jsonl .agents/specs/016-x/.sdlc/ledger.head.json
git commit -S -m "approve: 016-x requirements" -- .agents/specs/016-x/.sdlc/
```

The terminal and assistant checks are a courtesy. The guarantee is `vellum verify`'s signature
check, which nobody without the approver's signing key can satisfy.

### `vellum task start <spec> <task-id>`

The pre-execution check: the three artifacts exist and hold the approvals the policy requires,
bound to their current checksums, and the task's criterion and property references resolve.
On success it appends a Task Binding to the ledger and sets the task's marker to `[-]`; on
failure it writes nothing. Exit 0 started, 1 refused.

### `vellum task complete <spec> <task-id> --command=<cmd> [--timeout=<seconds>]`

Requires a Task Binding for the task whose checksums still match the artifacts (otherwise the
marker is reset to `[ ]` and the command refuses). Refuses a command text that matches a secret
pattern. Then it runs `<cmd>` through `/bin/sh -c` at the repository root — Vellum runs it; the
caller reports nothing — stopping it after `--timeout` seconds (default 600). It appends an
Evidence Entry with the real exit status (124 on timeout), start and finish timestamps,
duration, HEAD commit, a SHA-256 of the output and whether the working tree differed from HEAD
outside the spec directory. The output's tail is shown on stderr and never stored.

The marker becomes `[x]` only when the command exited 0 and the tree was clean. Exit 0 then;
exit 1 when the command failed (a failed attempt is recorded, the marker unchanged) or the
evidence was recorded as uncommitted.

There is no `--exit` option.

### Not implemented

`vellum check`, `vellum adopt` and `vellum sync` exit 2 with `not implemented: …`.

## Running the CLI

Nothing is published yet. In this repository, build and run the CLI package's entry:

```bash
pnpm build
node packages/cli/dist/cli.js status
```

Or run the bundle's bin, which is the same CLI: `node packages/vellum/dist/cli.js status`.
`packages/vellum/tests/pack.test.ts` packs that package, installs the tarball offline into a
temp directory and runs `vellum` and `vellum-mcp` from it.

In CI, run `lint` and `verify`. `verify` needs the full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) to resolve
approval commits and evidence ancestry, and the signing tools the policy's keys use.
