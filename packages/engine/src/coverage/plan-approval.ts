/**
 * @vellum/engine — Coverage gates plan approval (Requirement 20)
 *
 * A plan that leaves any criterion without a task, or any property without a
 * citing task, cannot be approved. This decides it; `vellum approve <spec>
 * tasks` refuses on it (criterion 20.4) and the Effective Lifecycle State
 * holds `PLAN_APPROVED` to it (criterion 20.3).
 *
 * Pure function - no I/O.
 *
 * @see requirements.md Criteria 20.1-20.4, 20.7
