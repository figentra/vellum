## Introduction

A command-line greeter that prints a greeting for a name and refuses an empty one.

## Glossary

- **Greeter**: the command-line program this spec describes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Greet a person by name

**User Story:** As a user, I want a greeting that names me, so that the output is personal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Greeter receives a non-empty name, THE Greeter SHALL print "Hello, <name>!" on one line.
2. IF the Greeter receives an empty name, THEN THE Greeter SHALL exit with status 2 and print nothing to stdout.

### Requirement 2: Say goodbye

**User Story:** As a user, I want a farewell, so that the program can close a session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Greeter receives the --bye option, THE Greeter SHALL print "Goodbye, <name>!" instead of the greeting.

export const DESIGN = `# Design Document

## Overview

One module, \`src/greet.mjs\`, exporting \`greet(name, { bye })\`; a test file exercises it with node's test runner.

## Correctness Properties

Property 1: Greeting names the person

For all non-empty names, the output is exactly "Hello, " followed by the name and "!".

**Validates: Requirements 1.1**

Property 2: Empty names are refused

For every empty or whitespace-only name, the Greeter exits 2 and writes nothing to stdout.

**Validates: Requirements 1.2**

Property 3: Farewell replaces greeting

For all names with --bye, the output is "Goodbye, " followed by the name and "!".

**Validates: Requirements 2.1**

## Testing Strategy

Unit tests with \`node --test\`.

export const TASKS = `# Implementation Plan

## Overview

Build the greeting, then the farewell. Two waves.

**Source documents:** \`requirements.md\`, \`design.md\` (both in this spec directory)

**Total leaf tasks:** 4 · **Optional leaf tasks:** 1 · **Waves:** 2

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Greeting core
  - [ ] 1.1 Implement greet() in src/greet.mjs _Requirements: 1.1_
  - [ ] 1.2 Refuse an empty name in src/greet.mjs _Requirements: 1.2_
  - [ ] 1.3* Unit tests for greet() in test/greet.test.mjs _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Checkpoint: ensure all tests pass

- [ ] 3. Farewell option in src/greet.mjs _Requirements: 2.1_

## Task Dependency Graph

\`\`\`json
{
  "waves": [
    { "id": 0, "tasks": ["1.1"] },
    { "id": 1, "tasks": ["1.2", "1.3", "3"] }
